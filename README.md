Project Overview:
This repository contains the code for a web application developed as part of an assessment for Alindor. The application utilizes machine learning models to analyze text or audio input and generate insights related to sentiment or psychological aspects of the conversation. The project is built using Python, Flask, and OpenAI's API for natural language processing.

Challenges Faced:
During the development process, I encountered several challenges, including integrating the OpenAI API for sentiment analysis, handling file uploads in Flask, and ensuring compatibility with different audio formats. However, through thorough research, experimentation, and collaboration with peers, I was able to address these challenges and implement robust solutions.

Instructions to Run the Code:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the necessary dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
Set up your environment variables, including your OpenAI API key, by creating a .env file in the project root directory and adding OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_api_key> to it.
Run the Flask application by executing python app.py in the terminal.
Access the web interface by navigating to http://localhost:5000 in your web browser.
Feel free to explore the codebase and experiment with different inputs to observe the model's behavior and insights generation.
